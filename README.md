# lambda-container

This example contains the minimal setup needed to build and run a Lambda docker container with the Python runtime. 

It consists of:
- Dockerfile
- app.py
- requirements.txt
- build.sh
- run.sh
- test.sh

This is based on the instructions found at:
[Deploy Python Lambda functions with container images](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/python-image.html)

Use this as a starting point for your Lambda Python projects.
